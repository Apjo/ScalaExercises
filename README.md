##About
This repository will contain solved examples for the exercises from the book "Scala for the Impatient" by Cay Horstman. 
Please note This is not a pure sbt project wherein you can build the project and run any application.
I have not solved the problems that involved declaring variables, or looking up the ScalaDocs, or any problem that required some theoretical answer.
Apologies for the same. 
Even though IntelliJ was used there is no special directory structure that was followed.

Unit Tests have been written using ScalaTest.
