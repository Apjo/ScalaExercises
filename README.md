##About
This repository will contain solved examples for the exercises from the book "Scala for the Impatient" by Cay Horstman. 
Please note This is not a pure sbt project wherein you can build the project and run any application.
I have not solved the problems that involved declaring variables, or looking up the ScalaDocs, or any problem that required some theoretical answer.
Apologies for the same.
